My teaching philosophy is rooted in the conviction that science education should foster curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence in problem-solving. I aim to empower students not only to master content but also to see themselves as capable of asking meaningful questions about the physical universe. To do this, I emphasize active engagement, interdisciplinary connections, and the development of scientific habits of mind. My goal is not simply to teach astronomy, physics, and basic science, but to help students cultivate the ability to reason scientifically, apply concepts to new situations, and see themselves as participants in the broader scientific enterprise.

Student Testimonials

"I valued Dr. Luber's patience and openness in presenting the course material as accessibly as possible. In a large lecture course setting, he still made the class feel active, participatory, and fun. This class was by no means easy, but the challenges were presented in ways that guided me to engage with the course material beyond rote memorization and regurgitation. "

"Dr. Luber is an engaging discussion leader. The content of \[Frontiers of Science\] can often feel far off and difficult to grab, but Dr. Luber’s more relaxed attitude and personal touch on seminar review, along with his emphasis on common sense and simple assumptions in science, made the material much easier to grasp and relate to. His additional activities, including debates, jeopardy, and climate summits, were incredibly informative, but also just a really fun way to engage with the material. They were without a doubt my favorite aspect of \[Frontiers of Science\] as a whole."

"What I valued most about this course was its unique approach to exploring the universe through both scientific concepts and imaginative questions—like the equation of alien life. It made learning feel both fun and thought-provoking. I especially appreciated how the course introduced complex physics equations in a way that was accessible and tied to real mysteries in space."

"Dr. Luber is great. He truly cares about his students and emphasizes the importance of learning rather than just knowing. He does not expect perfection and simply asks for participation and willingness to try. His seminars present the necessary information without too much detail and he spends extra time making sure that students know how to use the information they learn. His seminar was low-stress, high-reward, and I feel like I learned a lot about the frontiers topics, good student habits, and college in general from him."

"This was an absolutely fantastic course, and there are so many things to point out as valuable. The subject matter was fascinating in itself, but Dr. Luber's course structure made it even more engaging even to a non-science major like myself. I loved having the opportunity to understand the fundamental science behind our universe and the mechanics of our world and beyond. I also appreciated getting to explore the universe through a quantitative lens; for example, deriving the Drake Equation on our own throughout the course was extremely exciting and was a great way to combine empirical reasoning with the very intriguing subject of alien life."

"What truly set Dr.Luber apart was his genuine care for his students' well-being and academic progress. He created a supportive and inclusive learning environment, where every student felt valued and encouraged. Dr. Luber was always approachable, making himself available for questions, concerns, or additional guidance. He took the time to listen attentively and address our individual needs, providing personalized feedback and guidance whenever necessary. His patience and willingness to assist us fostered a sense of trust and motivation among the students."
