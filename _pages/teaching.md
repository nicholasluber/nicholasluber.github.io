My teaching philosophy is rooted in the conviction that science education should foster curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence in problem-solving. I aim to empower students not only to master content but also to see themselves as capable of asking meaningful questions about the physical universe. To do this, I emphasize active engagement, interdisciplinary connections, and the development of scientific habits of mind. My goal is not simply to teach astronomy, physics, and basic science, but to help students cultivate the ability to reason scientifically, apply concepts to new situations, and see themselves as participants in the broader scientific enterprise.

Student Testimonials

"What I valued most about this course was its unique approach to exploring the universe through both scientific concepts and imaginative questions—like the equation of alien life. It made learning feel both fun and thought-provoking. I especially appreciated how the course introduced complex physics equations in a way that was accessible and tied to real mysteries in space. It definitely met my expectations by making astronomy engaging and interactive. I would recommend this course to anyone curious about the universe or looking for a science class that sparks creativity while still being grounded in science." *Life in the Universe - Spring 2025*

"Dr. Luber is great. He truly cares about his students and emphasizes the importance of learning rather than just knowing. He does not expect perfection and simply asks for participation and willingness to try." *Frontiers of Science - Fall 2024*

"Dr. Luber is an engaging discussion leader. The content of \[Frontiers of Science\] can often feel far off and difficult to grab, but Dr. Luber’s more relaxed attitude and personal touch on seminar review, along with his emphasis on common sense and simple assumptions in science, made the material much easier to grasp and relate to. His additional activities, including debates, jeopardy, and climate summits, were incredibly informative, but also just a really fun way to engage with the material." *Frontiers of Science - Spring 2024*

"Dr. Luber has been an absolutely wonderful professor, and it has been a pleasure to be in his class. Although this was a large lecture, Dr. Luber felt extremely accessible and welcoming, and did an incredible job genuinely connecting with every student in his class. He is one of the most approachable and kindest professors I have ever had-- very available via office hours, email, etc. and more than willing to help. His lectures were brilliant, detailed, and genuinely fun. For someone who does not consider herself a STEM student, I found myself genuinely excited about doing math in Dr. Luber's class. I feel so very lucky to have been in his class this semester-- not only did he give me a new appreciation for the cosmos but was a bright spot of positivity and kindness every week."  *Life in the Universe - Spring 2024*

"What truly set Dr. Luber apart was his genuine care for his students' well-being and academic progress. He created a supportive and inclusive learning environment, where every student felt valued and encouraged. Dr. Luber was always approachable, making himself available for questions, concerns, or additional guidance. He took the time to listen attentively and address our individual needs, providing personalized feedback and guidance whenever necessary. His patience and willingness to assist us fostered a sense of trust and motivation among the students." *General Physics I - Summer 2023*
