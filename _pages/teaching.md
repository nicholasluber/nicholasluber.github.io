My teaching philosophy is rooted in the conviction that science education should foster curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence in problem-solving. I aim to empower students not only to master content but also to see themselves as capable of asking meaningful questions about the physical universe. To do this, I emphasize active engagement, interdisciplinary connections, and the development of scientific habits of mind. My goal is not simply to teach astronomy, physics, and basic science, but to help students cultivate the ability to reason scientifically, apply concepts to new situations, and see themselves as participants in the broader scientific enterprise.
